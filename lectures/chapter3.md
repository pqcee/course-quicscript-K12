# Chapter 3: The Identity gate ( I )

The simplest possible quantum gate is the 2 x 2 identity gate and it semantically corresponds to the behavior of the identity gate in classical computing. The Identity gate is like the "do nothing" gate, it doesn't change the qubit at all.

In quantum computing, we represent the identity gate using the letter 'I'. Mathematically, it can be expressed using the matrix below:

In essence, the linear transformation corresponding to the identity matrix can be viewed as an identity function. It is a type of function whose output is the same as its input. We can write it in the following way:

This is what happens when we apply it to a qubit:

When the identity gate is applied, the qubit state is left unchanged. The number of qubits required in the above circuit is '1'.
The number of qubits required in the circuit for this gate is '1.'
