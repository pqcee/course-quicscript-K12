# Chapter 4: The Pauli-X gate

The Pauli X gate is called the bit flip gate because it ends up swapping the probability amplitudes 'α' and 'β' with each other. We represent the Pauli-X gate with the letter 'X'. Mathematically it can be expressed using the matrix below:

The state of our qubit can be expressed as a linear combination of the basis vectors with 'α' and 'β' being the probability amplitudes as follows:

Using simple algebra, this is how we would express the X-gate:

Notice that 'α' and 'β' are flipped.

_Note: The number of qubits required in the circuit for this gate is '1.'_
