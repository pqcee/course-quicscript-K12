# Chapter 1: The Qubit

Qubits are the fundamental units of information in quantum computing, analogous to classical bits in classical computing. They can be stored in "quantum memory" and processed by a "quantum processor." In quantum information theory, we abstract qubits for practical programming. But what exactly is a qubit?
A qubit is like a classical bit, but it can exist in a superposition (Superposition is a quantum principle that refers to a physical system that exists in multiple states simultaneously based on a specific set of solutions). Instead of using "0" and "1" to label its two states, we represent them as follows:

|0⟩ and |1> (pronounced as 'ket-zero and ket-one respectively').

These vectors are an abstract way to describe the states of a qubit. We can combine them using linear combinations, introducing coefficients (called amplitudes) like this:

α|0⟩ + β|1⟩

'α' and 'β' are complex numbers. They represent the probability amplitudes of the qubit being in the state |0⟩ and |1⟩, respectively. Qubits can exist in a superposition of these states, where 'α' and 'β' can be both positive and negative. This property allows for quantum interference, a key element in quantum computing's power.
