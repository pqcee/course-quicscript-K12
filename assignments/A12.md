# QIS K12 Framework Guidelines

- Maintain a supportive atmosphere that encourages questions and exploration
- Offer collaborative, exploratory activities
- Offer a low-stakes educational setting (e.g. little time pressure without aggressive testing)
- When relevant to the STEM subject, employ a learning cycle approach to develop models of quantum systems and phenomena, plan and carry out investigations to test their models, analyze and interpret data, obtain, evaluate and communicate their findings

# Chapter 12: Real-World Quantum Circuits

Fun with Quantum Apps! ðŸš€

## Beginner Level (Ages 7-11)

Points: 100

### Task 1: Quantum Search Game (40 points)

Imagine you're playing hide and seek with quantum powers!

1. Using QuICScript's drag-and-drop:
   - Place a Hadamard gate (H) on your qubit
   - Take a screenshot of what happens
   - Tell us: How is this different from regular hide and seek?

### Task 2: Real World Connections (30 points)

Pick ONE:

1. Draw a picture showing:
   - Where you might use quantum computers in your daily life
   - Label 3 things in your picture
     OR
2. Write a short story about:
   - A day in the life of a quantum computer
   - What kind of problems does it help solve?

### Task 3: Show and Tell (30 points)

Create a mini-poster showing:

- Your favorite quantum gate
- What it does (in your own words)
- A fun fact about quantum computers

## Intermediate Level (Ages 12-14)
