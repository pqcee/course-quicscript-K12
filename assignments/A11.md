## Assignment 11

Quantum circuit for teleporting a qubit. The two top lines represent Alice’s system, while the bottom line is Bob’s system. The meters represent measurement, and the double lines coming out of them carry classical bits (recall that single lines denote qubits).

Expected result: 010,100.00%
