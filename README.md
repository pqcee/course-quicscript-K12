This is a pre-made course presenting an overview of a qubit, quantum gates, quantum circuits, and links students to resources where they can learn more on specific topics. QuICScript, a 20-qubit emulator that runs directly in your browser is used to provide students a quick way to start building quantum circuits.

## Topics

1. The Qubit
2. Quantum Circuits
3. Identity Gate
4. Pauli-X gate
5. Pauli-Y gate
6. Pauli-Z gate
7. Hadamard gate
8. Control Not / Toffoli gate
9. P/S: Phase shift π/2
10. T: Phase shift π/4
11. How to use multiple gates together
12. Important real-world Quantum Circuits
